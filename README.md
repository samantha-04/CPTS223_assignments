## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To compile and run:

cd PA1/
make
./pa1_main   # or ./test

## âœ… Testing

I include basic test drivers for each assignment, typically checking
Constructor / destructor behavior
Copy / move semantics ("The Big Five")
Insertion, deletion, traversal, edge-case handling
Memory safety (no leaks)
Correctness (correct output on sample data)
